# lauraaupert.github.io - A Portfolio

This website is my first attempt at a portfolio. It was created from scratch in HTML and uses a lot of Bootstrap elements, including a grid layout, a navbar, a dropdown menu, card elements, and a sticky bottom. I added a CSS file to ameliorate some of the styling elements. 
The navbar links all direct to different parts of my website: About, Portfolio, and Contact. The sticky bottom links to the Contact page as well. In the portfolio section, I added links to some of the activities I have been working on. 
Every page is responsive and the navbar is consistent. Images are responsive as well and have alt elements for accessibility. I also checked my code with an html validation service and I was very proud to only get very few tiny mistakes. 
Challenges: 
I could not get my dropdown to work because I had not realized I needed the Bootstrap JS link. That made me do a lot of extra work! 
Although everything is responsive, I have not figured out how to make the cards the same size. I do like that they go in increasing order, but it would be good to make sure they are the same size. 
Future work: I hope to make this website super better once I know more JavaScript! I could make it do cool stuff.
